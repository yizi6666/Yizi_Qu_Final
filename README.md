## **Background and Motivation**
This study explores how **parental absence due to labor migration** affects **child well-being** in China. With increasing internal migration, children left behind face **health, emotional, and educational challenges**. Understanding these effects using **machine learning** can inform **targeted policy interventions**.

---

## **Research Questions**
- **How does parental absence affect child health and well-being?**  
- **Is maternal absence more significant than paternal absence?**  
- **Can machine learning improve prediction accuracy in child welfare studies?**  

---

## **Application Scenarios**
- **Public Policy**: Identifying at-risk children for targeted welfare programs.  
- **Healthcare & Education**: Predicting health risks based on parental presence.  
- **NGOs & CSR**: Supporting child development initiatives using AI-driven insights.  

---

## **Methodologies**
- **Random Forest**: Classifying child health outcomes.  
- **SMOTE**: Balancing class distribution to improve minority class predictions.  
- **SHAP Analysis**: Identifying key predictors of child well-being.  
- **NLP**: Extracting interpretability insights from social narratives.  

---

## **Results: Random Forest & SMOTE Analysis**
- **Maternal absence has a stronger negative impact than paternal absence**.  
- **SMOTE improves classification for underrepresented groups but introduces noise**.  
- **SHAP analysis reveals parental presence as the dominant predictor of child health**.  

---

## **Intellectual Merits**
This study advances **machine learning applications in social science**, demonstrating how **AI-driven classification** improves child welfare research. It bridges the gap between **traditional econometric approaches** and **data-driven policy insights**, inspiring future studies in **explainable AI and longitudinal child development models**.

---

## **Practical Impacts**
- **Policy**: Supports evidence-based decisions for migrant child welfare.  
- **Industry**: AI-powered child health prediction tools for NGOs and government agencies.  
- **Ethics & AI Governance**: Ensures **fair, transparent, and privacy-conscious** machine learning applications in social policy.
